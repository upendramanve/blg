							<h3>The name of this hill station refers to the dense growth of jungle as its head. Matheran means a place topped by a jungle.</h3>
							<h4>By Rail/Train</h4>
							<p>Getting to Matheran is half the fun; It is well connected by rail both, from Mumbai and Pune up to Neral Junction Station, a station at the bottom of the hill. From Neral a small Toy Train (Narrow gauge) takes you through a zigzag route of about 21 kms. to Matheran in two hours time. It's a very scenic two hours ascent as the train winds its way around the steep slopes. Some marvelous valley scenes can be observed during this journey. Three small stations called Jumma Patti, Water Pipe and Aman Lodge are on the way to Matheran. </p>
							<p>The toy train can only be booked in advance from Mumbai or Pune which is a good idea in the high season (no reservations are accepted at Neral or Matheran but tickets go on sale 45 minutes before departure).</p>
							<p>Mumbai-Neral, 90 kms. Neral-Matheran,21 kms,</p>
							<p>From Mumbai CST, only a few of the Pune expresses stops at Neral Junction, including the Deccan Express and the Koyna Express. Most (but not all)of expresses from Mumbai stops at Karjat further down the line from Neral, from where you can backtrack on one of the frequent local trains. Alternatively, take a local Karjat bound train from Mumbai CST and get off at Neral.</p>
							<p>Pune-Neral, 120 kms. (Neral-Matheran mountain train)</p>
							<p>From Pune take a one of the few Mumbai bound expresses that stops at Neral (such as the Sahyadri Express) or one of the expresses which stops at Karjat and then get a local train from there up to Nerul.</p>
							<h4>By Road -> From Mumbai</h4>
							<p>Mumbai-Neral-Matheran, 108 kms.</p>
							<p>While going to Matheran by road, take Mumbai-Pune Highway(NH-4) upto Chowk Village and turn to Karjat road. From Karjat, the same road goes to Dasturi Naka, i.e. entrance of Matheran via Neral. </p>
							<p>Get on to the Mumbai Pune Expressway at Panvel (Near McDonalds). Get onto the expressway to avoid the congested road through Panvel. Take the first exit (Shedung/Khopoli Exit) that comes less than 5 minutes after you get onto the expressway at McDonalds. (Here you will need to Pay a Toll at the toll-booth for using the expressway). This exit gets you back onto the Old Mumbai-Pune Road. Follow directions to proceed towards Pune. Once again you will have to pay a toll for using the old Bombay Pune Road. (Toll in both places is about Rs.25 each).</p>
							<p>Follow the old Mumbai-Pune road for approximately 10 km. This will bring you to a crossing where a big green sign asks you to turn left for Karjat/Matheran. (Do not miss this crossing as otherwise you will end up in Khopoli. There is a large statue of Hindu god Shiva on right side of the old Mumbai-Pune Highway which can be seen from a long distance. The left turn about 50 metres before the statue).</p>
							<p>9 km After turning left you reach another crossing called Charphata Karjat where you need to turn left towards Neral.</p>
							<p>11 km After turning left, you will reach the bottom of the Matheran Hill ghat road.</p>
							<p>Turn left here and climb 7 km to the Matheran Dasturi Car park.</p>
							<h4>From Pune</h4>
							<p>Set off towards Mumbai on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. Get off the Pune-Mumbai Expressway at the Khopoli exit after passing Lonavla/Khandala and get onto the old Pune-Mumbai road. Approximately 18 km later, you turn right as per a big green sign, in Chouk town. Follow the signs from then on.</p>
							<p>One can also exit Pune-Mumbai NH4 at Haal Phata near Khopoli to enter SH 35 which will take you straight to the bottom of Matheran Ghat Road.</p>
							<h4>Car Parking and Entry </h4>
							<p>It is a steep and narrow road but well surfaced for the most part. When you reach the car park find a parking space in the designated area and park your car. The parking entrance fees and daily parking fees need to be paid here.</p>
							<p>No vehicles are allowed beyond this point. Matheran center is a 40-minute walk from Dasturi Car Park. Before you enter the limits of Matheran, Matheran Municipal council charges a fees of Rs 25 per adult and Rs 10 for children.</p>
							<p>Once you enter, red dusty pathways welcome you to the nature. Porters are available to carry luggage. You can enjoy the walks through the red pathways or ride on horse. Manual 'rickshaws'' are also available; each rickshaw is 'driven' by a couple of operators.</p>
							<p>Parking facilities are available at Dasturi Naka, Matheran. From this point into the town center, either a trek on foot or on horseback or by hand pulled rickshaws, as motor vehicles are prohibited within the hill-station area. During rainy season Train Services are not regular. Taxi takes about 20 minutes to reach Dasturi Naka from Neral. To go around Matheran, one has to walk or avail the services of horses or handcart (single seater).State Transport buses regularly ply from Mumbai and Pune. A taxi from Neral to Matheran takes about half hour to reach. Taxis stop about 2.5 km from the centre of the hill station.<strong>Vehicles of any kind are not permitted in the town, which makes it a very quiet, serene place.</strong></p>

                    <p>It's astonishing to travel by Toy train from Neral to Matheran a hill station in Raigad district in Maharashtra (India). Toy Trains journey takes around 281 thriller zigzag turns (ghat) from Neral to Matheran hill top.    </p>
                    <p>The toy train can only be booked in advance from Mumbai or Pune which is a good idea in the high season (no reservations are accepted at Neral or Matheran but tickets go on sale 45 minutes before departure).</p>
                    <p>The Matheran Railway is a small line of 2 ft. gauge constructed in the year 1907 and being rewarded World Heritage in by UNESCO. It's mode of transport to reach the plateau top in the near vicinity of the city of Mumbai. <strong>This railway is known as matheran toy train. Later the special Toy Train has honored by the name "PhulRani"</strong></p>
					<p>
Neral - Matheran - A hill station at an altitude of 800 meters (average height of 2500 feet above sea level), Matheran is 110 km. away from Mumbai on Mumbai-Pune rail route.</p>
					<p>A narrow gauge toy train from Neral (87 km. from Mumbai) meanders up the mountain, treating the tourists to a breathtaking view. </p>
					<p>Mr. Hugh Poyntz Malet, the then Collector of Thane, discovered Matheran (meaning "forest on the top") in May 1850. Lord Elphinstone, the then Governor of Mumbai laid foundations of the future development of Matheran as a hill station. This 2-foot narrow gauge hill railway, connecting Neral was opened to traffic in 1907.</p>
					<p>This hill railway was built by Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy, who formed a limited company with an authorised capital of ten lakh rupees divided into 2000 shares. The railway is 20 km. (12.6 miles) long and has a gauge of two feet with a ruling gradient of 1 in 20. The track zig zags up the side of the hill, bringing into view the full beauty of the Matheran Hill station. There are four pairs of train running between Neral and Matheran. However, during monsoon i.e. June to September, only one pair of train is run to open timings. </p>

It is crown placed in sahyadri hill Ranges, at 2400 feet above sea level.

</p><p>
Today in the 21st Century where Car, bike and Automobile became your life partner, even after doctor's suggestion you can not walk and breathe out of your Vehicle. We found that in the whole world, pollutions in the cities can not be controlled at any level. But the Matheran is calm! Calm!! Calm!!! Matheran is not just the city which left behind, but also the dissonance of traffic.
</p>
<p>
It's damn sure, 100% one will not hear even one single horn any where in Matheran. Cars, Bikes and any Automobile are not allowed up here. All the vehicles have to be park at Dasturi Naka, which 3 kms outside the main street of Matheran and this is the uniqueness of Matheran city. For such, Matheran is the only place in Asia and one of among the few places in the world.
</p>
<p>
The forest ecosystem at Matheran is unique and remarkable in many respects - its dense and lofty arboreal growth, peculiar blending of evergreen and moist deciduous species and moreover a high percentage of endemism and almost undisturbed natural climatic climax formations.
</p>
<strong>Fruits</strong>
<p>
Black-berries called Jambhuls in Marathi are abundant here. They are deep black in colour and very sweet in taste, though they are much smaller in-size compared to what we find in other places like Poona or Satara and other part of Maharashtra. Matheran's honey has a reputation of its own. It is found in three or four different Varieties. Besides these, Mangoes also are obtainable during the season and also jack fruit and smaller Black-berries-known as karvand in the vernacular.
</p>
<strong>Trees</strong>
<p>
Any visitor to Matheran, if he keeps his pair of eyes open, will come across several typical trees, little shrubs, wild vegetables, flowering plants and also some plants imported from a far for purposes of decoration. It is not possible to give a detailed description of each and every one of them. Yet we cannot pass on without briefly mentioning those that are more-common and more characteristic.The most common trees here are Anjani and Kadu Jambhul (also called Par Jambhul)

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Birds</span>
<br>
<br>
Whenever we visit a Point and sit in its thick shade the notes of the cuckoo and the Bulbul and various other birds provide heavenly music to our ears. The thicknesses of the trees hide the musicians from our view. But we crave to have a look at them. Matheran shows us numerous varieties of birds, which never meet our eyes in the cities, exhibiting different hues, different sizes and different voices, some sweet and some shrill.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Cuckoo : </span>
This is the Prince of all singing birds, and is heard singing all day during the monsoon.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Bulbul: </span>
This is also a favorite singing bird, and is very frequently found giving out its sweet notes on the way from the Louisa to the Porcupine Point at evening time.
<br>
<br>
There are many other birds also which seem to carry on a conversation with each other, one bird calling and another answering in a different tune.
<br>
<br>
Other birds are known, not for their voice, but for the beauty of their feathers. The most prominent amongst .these are the sunbird, the Robinson, the spotted Dove, the Parrot, the purple Honey sucker, and the Shriek. Shikra is a peculiar bird changing its colour now and again. His nest is a wonderful affair that might set even the best engineers thinking and his are said to possess medical properties.
<br>
<br>
The crow is markedly a rare bird here.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Wild Animals</span>
<br>
<br>
Lions and panthers are hardly found here.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Monkeys:</span>
  There are many numbers of monkeys here they are a very common sight, leaping from tree to tree or climbing the housetops. They are a restless race with bulky bodies and black faces, though" some have a red or a whitish tinge in the colour of their faces. It is a very funny spectacle to see their females clutching their little ones close under their bellies and jumping or their "Baba Lok" engaged in a hot quarrel. They never molest the passers by, though in some of them familiarity with mankind generates such an effrontery that they enter the houses and lay their hands on any thing they choose under the very nose of the occupants.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Horses</span>
are many in Matheran few are using for transportation for luggage and other are for visitors traveling. There are around 500 Horses in Matheran.
